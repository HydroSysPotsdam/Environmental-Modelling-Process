    "The use of models in earth, environmental and hydrosciences is ubiquitous. They are used for both scientific analysis and operational prediction. Each model is embedded in a modelling process, starting from the abstraction of the real system, the determination of parameters, the quantification of uncertainties, the formulation of objective functions, etc. In this course, the main elements of such a modelling process will be discussed and their adaptation to different models of Earth, environmental and hydro systems will be discussed.\n",

    "In this lecture series, we will be using _conda_ for managing our Python environments and dependencies. _Conda_ is a powerful package management tool that allows users to easily install, run, and update packages and their dependencies. It also enables you to create isolated environments to avoid conflicts between different libraries or Python versions. \n",

    "You can learn more about _conda_ and how to install it from the [Conda Installation Guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). While we assume that you already have Conda installed for this course, you are free to use any other package management tool of your choice (e.g., `pipenv` or `virtualenv`). However, all instructions provided here will be for Conda.\n",

    "**Setting Up Your Environment**\n",

    "Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your `requirements.txt` file is located. You can do this with the following command:\n",

    "To activate the newly created environment, use the following command. Once activated, your terminal will switch to the EnvMod environment, and you can now run any Python code or Jupyter notebooks in this isolated environment. Remember, that you always need to enable the environment before executing Python code.\n",
