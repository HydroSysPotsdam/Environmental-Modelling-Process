    "The use of models in earth, environmental and hydrosciences is ubiquitous. They are used for both scientific analysis and operational prediction. Each model is embedded in a modelling process, starting from the abstraction of the real system, the determination of parameters, the quantification of uncertainties, the formulation of objective functions, etc. In this course, the main elements of such a modelling process will be discussed and their adaptation to different models of Earth, environmental and hydro systems will be discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lectures will go hand in hand with practical exercises using software to implement the modelling process (e.g. www.safetoolbox.info).\n",
    "Students will be able to focus both as a group (in a flipped classroom) and individually (through a term paper) on specific elements of interest. \n",
